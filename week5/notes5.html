  <h3>Exeptions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>An exception is an error that produces a return value that
       can then be used by the program to deal with the error. For 
       example, trying to call a method that is nonexistent will 
       result in a reference error that raises an exception, as you 
       can see in the example below when we try to call the mythical 
       unicorn() function:</li>
       <li>unicorn();
        << ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Warnings</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that 
        isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the 
        program will continue to run after a warning. This might sound 
        good, but it can be problematic, since the issue that produced 
        the warning may cause the program to continue running incorrectly.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Linting Tools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>JS Lint</li>
    <li>JS Hint</li>
    <li>ES Lint</li>
    <p>Linting tools such asJS Lint,JS Hint,andES Lintcan be used to 
      test the quality of JavaScript code, beyond simply using strict 
      mode. They are designed to highlight any sloppy programming 
      practices or syntax errors, and will complain if certain style 
      conventions are not followed, such as how code is indented. 
      They can be very unforgiving and use some opinionated coding 
      conventions, such as not using the ++ and -- increment operators 
      (in the case of JS Lint). Linting tools are also useful for 
      enforcing a programmingstyle guide. This is particularly useful 
      when you are working in a team, as it ensures everybody follows 
      the same conventions.</p>
  </ul>
  <h3>Debugging in the Browser</h3>
  <h4>The trusty Alert</h2>
  <p>I've used this myself.  It can show you how far your code has gotten
    before it fails.  alert().
  </p>
  <h4>Using the Console</h4>
  <p>This is another way to catch errors.  console.log() is common. Console.trace()
    is one that I haven't used myself.  Yet.
  </p>
  <h3>Debugging tools</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Breakpoints</li>
    <li>The <samp>debugger </samp>command is one of the most useful.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Error objects</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Error()</li>
    <li>EvalError()</li>
    <li>RangeError()</li>
    <li>ReferenceError()</li>
    <li>SyntaxError()</li>
    <li>TypeError()</li>
    <li>URIError()</li>
    <li>InternalError()</li>
    <p>All error objects have a number of properties, but they’re often 
      used inconsistently across browsers. The only properties that are 
      generally safe to use are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The name property returns the name of the error constructor 
        function used as a string, such as 'Error' or 'ReferenceError'.</li>
      <li>The message property returns a description of the error and 
        should be provided as an argument to the Error constructor function.</li>
      <li>The stack property will return a stack trace for that error. This 
        is a non-standard property and it’s recommended that it is not safe 
        to use in production sites.</li>
      </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Throwing Exeptions</h3>
  <p>So far we’ve seen errors that are thrown automatically by the JavaScript 
    engine when an error occurs. It’s also possible to throw your own exceptions 
    using the throw statement. This will allow for any problems in your code to 
    be highlighted and dealt with, rather than lurk quietly in the background.</p>

    <p>The throw statement can be applied to any JavaScript expression, 
      causing the execution of the program to stop. For example, all the 
      following lines of code will cause a program to halt:</p>
    
    <p>throw 2;
    throw 'Up';
    throw { toys: 'out of pram' };
    It is best practice, however, to throw an error object. This can then be 
    caught in a catch block</p>
        
    <p>throw new Error('Something has gone badly wrong!');
    As an example, let’s write a function called squareRoot() to find the 
    square root of a number. This can be done using the Math.sqrt() method, 
    but it returns NaN for negative arguments. This is not strictly correct 
    (the answer should be an imaginary number, but these are unsupported in 
    JavaScript). Our function will throw an error if the user tries to use a 
    negative argument:</p>
    <p>
    function squareRoot(number) {
        'use strict';
        if (number < 0) {
            throw new RangeError('You can't find the square root of 
            negative numbers')
        }
        return Math.sqrt(number);
    };</p>
    <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
    <h4>Try, Catch, and Finally</h4>
    <p>function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {
      'use strict';
      try {
          return String(squareRoot(number));
      } catch(error) {
          return squareRoot(-number)+'i';
      }
  }</p>
  <h4>Tests</h4>
  <p>Testing is an important part of programming that can often be 
    overlooked. Writing good tests means your code will be less brittle 
    as it develops, and any errors will be identified early on.</p>
  <h3>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</h3>
  <p>Test-driven development(TDD) is the process of writing tests before 
    any actual code. Obviously these tests will initially fail, because 
    there is no code to test. The next step is to write some code to make 
    the tests pass. After this, the code is refactored to make it faster, 
    more readable, and remove any repetition. The code is continually 
    tested at each stage to make sure it continues to work. This process 
    should be followed in small piecemeal chunks every time a new feature 
    is implemented, resulting in the following workflow:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
      <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
      <li>Refactor the code</li>
      <li>Test refactored code</li>
      <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
    </ol>
