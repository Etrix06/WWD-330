<h1>Week 2 Notes</h1>
<ul>
  <li><p>This week I began trying to create my links in the index page dynamically.</p></li>
  <li><p>I did several W3Schools tutorials on arrays and functions with arrays.
  Until I stumbled upon the append and append child HTML DOM methods.</p></li>
  <li><p>I tried various ways to manipulate the DOM elements to something that resembled
  what I envisioned in my head.  I got it to add a link to my index but not dynamically 
  like I wanted.  I went to bed Tuesday night thinking about it and I had a dream of 
  putting my addToIndex inside a For loop and loop it until the end of the index.</p></li>
  <li><p>On Wednesday after work I sat down and made the loop, and to my surprise it worked
  like a charm.</p></li>
  <li><p>On Wednesday I also began to practice the exercises in the additional links in the 
  reading.</p></li>
  <li><p>I have been unable to purchase a Sharepoint code to do the reading for the week</p></li>
  <li><p>I met with my group 1 team and worked our way through the first group assignment.
         I feel like I got lucky with a good group, they seemed to be knowlegeable and 
         good workers.  I feel like I will be able to learn from them.</p></li>
  <li><p>As of Saturday night (5/1/2021) I haven't been able to purchase the sitepoint
         Access code to do the weekly readings.</p></li>
 
</ul>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>More of a concern really, Will I get a week behind due to me not able to get the 
  readings for the week? </li>
