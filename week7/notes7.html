    <h3>Call and Apply Methods</h3>
    <p>call()  can be added to any function.  The first argument is always the 
      value of <samp>this</samp></p>
    <p>apply() method works in the same way, except the arguments of the 
        function are provided as an array, even if there is only one argument:</p>
        <p>square.apply(null, [4])</p>
          <p><< 16</p>

    <h1>AJAX</h1>
    <p>Clients and Servers.</p>
    <p>Ajax allows JavaScript to request resources from a server on behalf of the client. 
      The resources requested are usually JSON data or small fragments of text or HTML 
      rather than a whole web page.</p>
      <p>Same-Origin Policy</p>
      <p>The same-origin policy in browsers blocks all requests from a domain that is 
        different from the page making the request. This policy is enforced by all modern 
        browsers and is to stop any malicious JavaScript being run from an external source. 
        The problem is that the APIs of many websites rely on data being transferred 
        across domains.</p>
      <p>Solved by using Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)</p>
      <p>The CORS standard works by using HTTP headers to indicate which domains can 
        receive data. A website can have the necessary information in its headers to 
        allow external sites access to its API data. Most modern browsers support this 
        method and respect the restrictions specified in the headers.</p>
      <p>Ajax becoming popular meant that Now users could see new content on web pages 
        without having to refresh the page. Shopping baskets could be updated in the 
        background, partial page content could be loaded seamlessly, and photo galleries 
        could dynamically load images.</p>
      <h3>APIs</h3>
      <p>An application programming interface (API) is a collection of methods that 
        allows external access to another program or service. Many websites allow 
        controlled access to their data via public APIs. This means that developers 
        are able to interact with the data and create mashups of third-party services. 
        A weather site, for example, might have an API that provides methods that 
        return information about the weather in a given location, such as temperature, 
        wind speed, and so on. This can then be used to display local weather data on 
        a web page. The information thatâ€™s returned by APIs is often serialized as JSON. 
        Since the data is being provided by an external site, CORS will have to be 
        enabled in order to access information from an API. Some services may also 
        require authentication in order to access their APIs.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>How do you know what arguments are passed as parameters?  Example in the 
      book it called the sayHello.call(clark, 'how do you do') function.  I don't 
    what is happening with the parameters.</li>
    <li>How can I use Memoization effectively?</li>
    <li>It might be a little late in the semester to ask this, but how do I make the functions 
      shown in the reading without using console log or an alert.  Or without changing the HTML?
