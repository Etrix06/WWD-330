<h1>Week 3 Notes</h1>
<ul>
  <li><p>This week I began trying to access the reading
    with no success.</p></li>
    <li><p>I spent the beginning part of the week studying
      the W3Chools javascript objects section.</p></li>
    <li><p>Had a good meeting on Wednesday with the group.
      We worked out all of the tasks and strech challenges
    </p></li>    
    <li><p>Finally, got my code to begin reading Novice to Ninja.</p></li>
    <li><p>One of my teammates helped me connect my git to VS Code. 
      It had been connected to Notepad ++. And although it worked 
      great.  VS Code seemed to be more user friendly, however,
      it didn't connect to my github account.  Lautaro helped me.
    </p></li>  
    <li><p>Added reading links to my main portfolio page for easy access.</p></li> 
    <li><p>Began reading the week 3 but decided to go back
      and practice on weeks 2 reading and catch up on week 3 when possible.
    </p></li>
     
</ul>

<h2>Functions</h2>
<h3>Declarations</h3>
<p>a function literal looks like this:
</p>
<p>function hello() { console.log("hello world!"); };  </p>
<p>A function can also be defined with a function expression.  Like this:</p>
<p>const goodbye = function() { console.log("Goodbye"); };  This is an unnamed function.</p>
<p>const goodbye = function bye(){
  console.log('Goodbye World!');
};  It can also be named like this.</p>
<p>Parameter and arguments examples</p>
<p>function square(x){
  return x*x;
}</p>
<p>When we invoke this function, we need to provide an argument, which is the number to be squared:

  square(4.5);</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>



<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>What is the benefit of defining a function using an expression? </li>
  <li>The reading have examples without using console.log.  How do they work without console logs?
    Or are they just leaving the console.log part of it out.
  </li>
