<h1>Week 3 Notes</h1>
<ul>
  <li><p>This week I began trying to access the reading
    with no success.</p></li>
    <li><p>I spent the beginning part of the week studying
      the W3Chools javascript objects section.</p></li>
    <li><p>Had a good meeting on Wednesday with the group.
      We worked out all of the tasks and strech challenges
    </p></li>    
    <li><p>Finally, got my code to begin reading Novice to Ninja.</p></li>
    <li><p>One of my teammates helped me connect my git to VS Code. 
      It had been connected to Notepad ++. And although it worked 
      great.  VS Code seemed to be more user friendly, however,
      it didn't connect to my github account.  Lautaro helped me.
