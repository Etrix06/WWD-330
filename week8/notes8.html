    <h1>Chapter 8 Transform and Transitions</h1>
    <h2>Transform</h2>
    <p>We can manipulate an element’s appearance using <samp>transform </samp> functions. 
      The value of the transform property is one or more transform functions 
      (separated by spaces) that will be applied in the order they’re provided.</p>
      <h3>Translation functions</h3>
      <p>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. 
        These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring 
        top and left , moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y 
        axes.</p>
      <h3>Scaling</h3>
      <p>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally 
        then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x 
        and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while 
        maintaining the original aspect ratio.</p>
      <h3>Rotation</h3>
      <p>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a 
        specified angle value. As with scale , by default the point of origin is the 
        element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positive 
        degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise.</p>
      <h3>Skew</h3>
      <p>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d 
        expect, the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew 
        on the y axis. If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur 
        on the x axis.</p>
      <h2>Transitions</h2>
      <p>Animation has certainly been possible for some time with JavaScript, but 
        native CSS transitions generally require less client-side processing, so 
        they’ll usually appear smoother. On mobile devices with limited computing 
        power, this can be a lifesaver.</p>

    <li>How can I get Transform to work? Is the frist question.  For some reason it
      doesn't work on my browser. </li>
    <li>When do you use transitions?  I can't recall ever seeing them in a website.</li>
