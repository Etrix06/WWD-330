<h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
<ul>
  <li><p>This is more of a recap than actual notes taken during the week.</p></li>
  <li><p>I began the week by doing the reading.  It was straight forward 
         and easy to understand.</p></li>
  <li><p>This was my first time using github so it took me several days, 
         and several test repositories to get my footing.</p></li>
  <li><p>I then started working on my portfolio starting with my index page.</p></li>
  <li><p>This is what took me the most due to a year passing since my CS213 class.</p></li>
  <li><p>I got to step 3 of making my portfolio and was able to see my index page 
         the github website.</p></li>
  <li><p>I'm actually stuck on step 04 Dynamic Table of Contents</p></li>
  <li><p>I decided to skip that step, for now, and continued with step 05 "record your work"
         which is what I am doing right now.  I will continue working on making
         this a dynamic Table of Contents.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>How to link files in a folder one level up? I can't remember. </li>
  <li>How do you dynamically change the table of contents using an array for the links?</li>
 
</ol>
