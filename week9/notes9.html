    <h1>Chapter 9: The Window Object</h1>
    <h3>The Browser Object Model</h3>
    <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods 
      that contain information about the browser and computer screen. For example, we can find 
      out which browser is being used to view a page (though, this method is unreliable). We 
      can also find out the dimensions of the screen it is viewed on, and which pages have 
      been visited before the current page. It can also be used for the rather dubious practice 
      of creating pop-up windows, if youâ€™re into annoying your users.</p>
    <h3>Global Variables</h3>
    <p>All the way back in Chapter 2, we introduced the concept of global variables. These are 
      variables that are created without using the const , let or var keywords. Global variables 
      can be accessed in all parts of the program.

      Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser environment, the 
      global object is the window object. This means that any global variable created is actually 
      a property of the window object</p>
    <h3>Dialogs</h3>
    <p>alert(), confirm(), and prompt() can be used to stop the program until user continues through
      the alert.</p>
    <h3>Browser Info</h3>
    <p>Browser use- window.navigator.userAgent</p>
    <p>Find URL of current website use- window.location.href</p>
    <h3>Browser History</h3>
    <p>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited 
      pages in the current browser session. Avoid confusing this with the new HTML5 History API. 
      (See http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-history-pushstate/ post for details.)

      The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at 
      the current page.
      
      The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page:</p>
    <button onclick="openPopUp()">Pop Up window.</button>
    <br>
    <h3>The Document Object</h3>
    <p>Each window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal 
      with the page that has been loaded into the window. In Chapter 6, we covered the Document Object 
      Model and the properties and methods used to manipulate items on the page. The document object 
      contains a few other methods that are worth looking at.</p>
    <p>
      document.write()
     The write() method simply writes a string of text to the page. If a page has already loaded, it 
     will completely replace the current document:
     
     document.write('Hello, world!');
     This would replace the whole document with the string Hello, world! . It is possible to include 
     HTML in the string and this will become part of the DOM tree. For example, the following piece of 
     code will create an h1 tag node and a child text node:</p>
