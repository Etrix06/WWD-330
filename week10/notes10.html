    <h1>Client-side form validation</h1>
    <p>Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure all required form 
      controls are filled out, in the correct format. This is called client-side form 
      validation, and helps ensure data submitted matches the requirements set forth in 
      the various form controls.</p>
      <p>Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user 
        experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it 
        straight away. If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a noticeable delay 
        is caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell 
        the user to fix their data.</p>
        <h3>Form Validation</h3>
        <p>Go to any popular site with a registration form, and you will notice that they 
          provide feedback when you don't enter your data in the format they are expecting. 
          You'll get messages such as:<br>

          "This field is required" (You can't leave this field blank).<br>
          "Please enter your phone number in the format xxx-xxxx" (A specific data format 
          is required for it to be considered valid).<br>
          "Please enter a valid email address" (the data you entered is not in the right format).<br>
          "Your password needs to be between 8 and 30 characters long and contain one uppercase 
          letter, one symbol, and a number." (A very specific data format is required for your data).<br>
          This is called form validation. When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server 
          will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set 
          by the application. Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation, 
          while validation done on the server is called server-side validation. In this chapter 
          we are focusing on client-side validation.</p>
          <h3>Different types of client-side validation</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Built-in form Validation</li>
              <li>JavaScript</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Built-in validation</h4>
            <p>One of the most significant features of HTML5 form controls is the ability to 
              validate most user data without relying on JavaScript. This is done by using 
              validation attributes on form elements. We've seen many of these earlier in the 
              course, but to recap:</p>
              <ul><li>required: Specifies whether a form field needs to be filled in before the 
                form can be submitted.</li>
              <li>minlength and maxlength: Specifies the minimum and maximum length of textual 
                data (strings)</li>
              <li>min and max: Specifies the minimum and maximum values of numerical input types</li>
              <li>type: Specifies whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or some 
                other specific preset type. </li>
              <li>pattern: Specifies a regular expression that defines a pattern the entered data 
                needs to follow.</li></ul>
                <h4>Example</h4>
                <form>
                  <p>
                  <fieldset>
                  <legend>Do you have a driver's license?<abbr title="This field is mandatory" aria-label="required">*</abbr></legend>
                  <!-- While only one radio button in a same-named group can be selected at a time,
                  and therefore only one radio button in a same-named group having the "required"
                  attribute suffices in making a selection a requirement -->
                  <input type="radio" required name="driver" id="r1" value="yes"><label for="r1">Yes</label>
                  <input type="radio" required name="driver" id="r2" value="no"><label for="r2">No</label>
                  </fieldset>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <label for="n1">How old are you?</label>
                  <!-- The pattern attribute can act as a fallback for browsers which
                  don't implement the number input type but support the pattern attribute.
                  Please note that browsers that support the pattern attribute will make it
                  fail silently when used with a number field.
                  Its usage here acts only as a fallback -->
                  <input type="number" min="12" max="120" step="1" id="n1" name="age"
                  pattern="\d+">
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  <label for="t1">What's your favorite fruit?<abbr title="This field is mandatory" aria-label="required">*</abbr></label>
                  <input type="text" id="t1" name="fruit" list="l1" required
                  pattern="[Bb]anana|[Cc]herry|[Aa]pple|[Ss]trawberry|[Ll]emon|[Oo]range">

              <button>Submit</button>

        <h4>JavaScript Validation</h4>
        <p>You must use JavaScript if you want to take control over the look and feel 
          of native error messages or to deal with legacy browsers that do not support 
          HTML's built-in form validation. In this section we will look at the different 
          ways to do this.</p>
