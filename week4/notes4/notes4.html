  <h3>Forms</h3>
  <li><p>Made up of form elements <<samp>form</samp>></p></li>
    <li><p>Each form control has an initial value that 
      can be specified in the HTML code. This value can 
      be changed by a user entering information or 
      interacting with the form’s interface (such as 
      using a slider to increase or decrease a value). 
      The value can also be changed dynamically using 
      JavaScript.</p></li>
      <p>Here is an example of a search form.</p>
      <a href="search.html">Search HTML</a>


    <p>We can access forms in different ways.</p>
    <ol><li>const form = document.forms[0];</li>
    <li>const form = document.getElementsByTagname('form')[0];</li>
    <li>By the name attribute: const form = document.forms.search;</li>
    <li>const form = document.forms['search'];</li></ol>
    <li><p>You can stop a form from being submitted by using preventDefault()</p></li> 
    <p>Here is the hero or villan fill form.</p>
    <a href="hero.html">Hero HTML</a>

    <h3>OO Programming</h3>
    <p>Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations
       of objects in the real world. There are three main concepts in OOP:</p>
    <li><p> encapsulation</p></li>
    <p>The inner workings are kept hidden inside the object and only the 
      essential functionalities are exposed to the end user, such as the 
      'on' button. In OOP, this involves keeping all the programming logic 
      inside an object and making methods available to implement the 
      functionality, without the outside world needing to knowhowit’s done.</p>
    <li><p> polymorphism</p></li>
    <p>The same process can be used for different objects. In OOP, this means 
      various objects can share the same method, but also have the ability to 
      override shared methods with a more specific implementation.</p>
    <li><p> inheritance</p></li>
    <p>Taking the features of one object then adding some new features. In OOP, 
      this means we can take an object that already exists and inherit all its 
      properties and methods. We can then improve on its functionality by 
      adding new properties and methods.</p>
      <li>Rule of thumb:  get in the habit of constructing literal arrays
        Instead of the constructor function.
      </li>
</ul>
<h4>Classes and Constructor functions</h4>
<p>constructor function use <samp>this </samp> keyword inside the function.</p>
<p>The <samp>new </samp>keyword is used to create an instance of a function.</p>
<p>Built in constructor functions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object</li>
<li>Array</li>
<li>Function</li>
</ul>
<p>All objects also have a <samp>constructor </samp>property that returns the 
constructor function that created it.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>How is the <samp>this </samp>keyword working in my objects and functions?</li>
  <li>Why would you need to use Static Methods in industry?  What are some of 
    its uses?
  </li>
